## Contribution
Contribution is always welcome, since this is the point of this project. You can create addons for SangeFault by editing the pack itself, and it will be reviewed and merged in the addons branch.

## Versioning
Since release 1.0.3, I'm using a versioning system for releases, because this pack is still Work in Progress.
I'll be naming:
- Major releases (1.0, 1.1, etc.) as MR
- Minor releases (1.0.1, 1.1.4, etc.) as mR
- Patches (1.0.1.1, 1.0.1.2, etc.) as pR
