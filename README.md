Hello there! Thanks for trying out world's first complex open-source Minecraft resourcepack for 1.8.9 first of all! I am very thankful for that :D.

### Installation using your graphical interface

    - Paste in the zip file which was **inside** the zip file you downloaded earlier.

## Update Instructions
This is how you update my pack to the latest release. This pack is far from finished, y'know?
### Update using graphical interface
1. Download the latest release
2. Follow the installation instructions for your os.
3. Start Minecraft and enjoy!

### Update using command-line
1. Go into your folder again (as explained) and run the command `git pull` instead of the `git clone` command.

## Versioning
Since release 1.0.3, I am using a versioning system for releases, since this pack is still WIP.
I'll be naming:
- Major releases (1.0, 1.1, etc.) as MR
- Minor releases (1.0.1, 1.1.4, etc.) as mR
- Patches (1.0.2.1, etc.) as PR
(May be changed in the future)
